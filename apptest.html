	<h1>Wireframe testing</h1>
	<h2>Background Information</h2>
	<p>You will be testing a wireframe for a potential vocabulary learning app. There are no right or wrong answers. This is not a beauty pageant, and we are not rating things based on looks. Think about whether the actual features of the app meet your needs.</p>
<p>The app was designed for iPhone 6. It may or may not fit your device screen well. That is ok. Pretend it does. Pretend that this is a real app.</p>
	<p>Before you begin, please start a <b>screen recording</b> of your phone screen. If you do not know how to do this, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-record-your-android-or-iphones-screen-1844456499">click here to learn how to make a screen recording</a>.</p>
	<p>Thank you again for participating!</p>
	
	<h2>Tasks</h2>
	
	<ol>
		<li>You've decided to start practicing Spanish outside of your Spanish 101 course. Open the app, set it up, and learn to use it.</li>
		<li>"Hold up," you think. "How can I be successful if I don't even study the basics?" Go study the basics!</li>
		<li>You realized that you registered with the name "Test User". However, your name is "Bob User". Correct this error.</li>
		<li></li>
	</ol>
